## Kailo - A React/Redux Dashboard System

Kailo is my work on how we can use React with a Redux powered store to make a Dashboard Board for any web application.
This is a work in progress though.
Following are the main frameworks/plugins being used:

1. React
2. Redux
3. React JSS for CSS and themeing.
4. FontAwesome for Icons.
5. HighCharts for Charts/PieCharts.

# How to run:

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn start` to start server `localhost:3000`
